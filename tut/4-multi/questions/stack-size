The process might call a syscall like mmap() to allocate memory below the bottom
of the current stack. Or a custom syscall similar to sbrk couold be added that grows the stack down
rather than increasing the heap.

Or a process could work like in Go where it is expected to check how much stack is left and will allocate a new
chunk of memory in the heap (again, using mmap()) and will just support a discontinuous stack.
