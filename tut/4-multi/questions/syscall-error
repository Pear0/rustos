The disadvantage of our use is that one register is dedicated to handling the error condition response
where many syscalls will only return a valid (positive) value in one of the registers. Unix more efficiently
packs it.


The advantage is that decoding oof the Result becomes much simpler and it is harder to accidentally
confuse a data value and an error code.
