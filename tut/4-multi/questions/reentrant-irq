Some IRQs are more important than others. For example a sound driver IRQ that needs to fill
the sound card's DMA buffer may interrupt an IRQ that is handling a network packet response.

If sound misses an IRQ, the user will definitely notice the audio skip, but a dropped network packet isn't
very important.
