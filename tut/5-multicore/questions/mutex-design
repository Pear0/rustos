You need to create a "box" with your Mutex implementation

At the top there must be a compare_and_swap with Acquire semantics. This is the top of the box and prevents
loads/stores from wandering before the compare_and_swap succeeds.

At the bottom you need a store with Release semantics. This prevents stores from wandering after the atomic
store occurs.
