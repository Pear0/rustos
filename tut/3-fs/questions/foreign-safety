Rust's safety is embedded into the API/type system. Without having the source code for a Rust library,
Rust can still guarantee safety. Since other languages don't have the same thing built in (because most FFI goes through `C` ABI LOL)
there's no way Rust knows for sure what is safe and since the Rust compiler did not compile the other code, it doesn't
want to assume that it's safe.
