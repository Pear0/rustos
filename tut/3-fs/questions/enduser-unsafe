Safety in Rust is inductive, unfortunately interfacing with the outside world is unsafe.
If we add code that forces memory safety when interacting with the outside world, the rust is our
code that relies on it is safe by induction. Of course the "safe" rust code is only truly safe
if the base "unsafe-to-safe" code is sound (and the compiler/OS/hardware/etc has no bugs), but it
decreases the suspect code that may cause a memory issue.
