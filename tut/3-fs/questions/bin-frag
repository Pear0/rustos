My external fragmentation is highly optimal right now.

To improve internal fragmentation, I could switch from power of 2 bin sizing to multiple of 8 bin sizing for smaller
bins.

If this were a threaded allocator, I could also have a background process coalesce bins slowly to avoid
death by a million tiny bins.
